# Canada's sale taxes API

Here's an API to get canadian sales tax informations. Simple as that.

The API is now at `v2`. `v3` is curently being worked on, to allow for authentication of users. It is planned to deprecate `v1` and `v2` over time when the next version is live.

If you see any discrepancies in actual data, missing future rates or want to contribute historical rates, please open an issue on the Github repository with the data and we'll include it in the API.
